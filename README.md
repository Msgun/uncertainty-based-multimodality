This repository contains implementation of the paper titled "Multi-Modal Learning for Uncertain Cases of Alzheimer's Disease Identification". Paper currently under reviw.

We adapted EDL codes from the [pytorch-classification-uncertainty repo](https://github.com/dougbrion/pytorch-classification-uncertainty).

Our trained Keras models can be downloaded from [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Hi3BLR_Bc3RnA95ojs1_l-x2JM1IFK9m?usp=sharing)
